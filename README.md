# Chicken Jump

Imagine: a chicken running joyously across the vast green fields, under a serene azure sky with marshmallow clouds. From time to time, it comes across delicious treats, which it enjoys thoroughly.

In Chicken Jump, you are that chicken.

Chicken Jump is an indie 2D infinite scrolling platformer game developed, with passion, by a totally legit intern at a totally real company.
